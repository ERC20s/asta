1. User logs into game. (Ethereum address: 0x001)
2. Goes to scene. Selects astar logo.(Network)
3. Wants to buy an NFT (transaction-details)
4. We give them a popup URL: BUITL.COM/0x001/Astar/nft-data
5. BUITL.com asks user to access their polkadot wallet to get all polkadot addresses (including astar address).
6. User is then asked to sign the transaction.
7. Then the BUITL.com popup is closed once confirmed.
8. Next time the user does a transaction in-game to buy something we get the same popup but won't need to confirm

Bonus:
We store the users polkadot data to their ethereum address on the backend so we can use it in-game.
